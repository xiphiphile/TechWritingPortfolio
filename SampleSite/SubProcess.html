<H2>SubProcess Usage</h2>
<hr>
<p>The subprocess box can be useful for simplifying or decluttering your workflows. This shape stands in for a complex process which can either be called out as a separate flow or in the step-by-step automated process description.</p>

<p>Some good times to use this tool include:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a complex set of steps that happens repeatedly in your flow.</li>
<li>your process strings multiple automations or modules together.</li>
<li>Your flow is getting unmanageably large or difficult to follow.</li>
</ul>
<div class="exampleblock">
<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<p>Below we see where two processes are optional in the User Form, and each can occur multiple times. By breaking them out as subprocess boxes, we make the overall flow easier to follow and reduce the need to repeat a complex set of steps multiple times on the page.</p>
